## Repository

The github repository for this project is at https://github.com/hcorrada/mldm_project3. You should have received an email from github to access the repository.

## Part I: Introduction to Tensor Flow

Follow the Introduction to Tensor Flow provided in the `partI_shell.ipynb` IPython notebook. Your task is to re-implement your linear SVM algorithm using gradient descent
using tensor flow. You don't need to run it on a specific dataset, as I will only look at the implementation. For debugging, you can try using the iris dataset: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html

## Part II: Supervised methods for time series forecasting

We will be using the mortgage affordability provided by Zillow https://www.zillow.com/research/data/. For this part you will implement a single layer neural net, and a deep neural net for
time series forecasting. Follow the instructions in `partII_shell.ipynb`.

## Part III: Recurrent Neural Nets

COMING SOON
